🐶 Dog Breed Classifier: Transfer Learning for Dog Breed Identification

Dog Breed Classifier is an AI-powered web application that automatically identifies dog breeds from images using deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

The system uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network model such as TensorFlow / Keras VGG19 and fine-tunes it on a dataset of dog breeds. Users can upload an image through a web interface, and the system predicts the dog breed instantly.

This project aims to assist pet owners, veterinarians, animal shelters, and researchers in accurately identifying dog breeds.

🎯 Project Objectives
- To build an AI-powered dog breed classification system
- To apply transfer learning using a pre-trained CNN model
- To develop an interactive web interface using Flask
- To enable real-time breed prediction from images
- To follow professional GitHub and version control practices

🚀 Features
- Upload image of a dog
- AI-based breed identification
- Real-time prediction results
- User Registration & Login system
- Secure password storage
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Local database support
- Easily extendable to more breeds

🐕 Supported Categories
Multiple dog breeds (e.g., Labrador, Pug, German Shepherd, etc.)
Note: More breeds can be added by retraining the model.
